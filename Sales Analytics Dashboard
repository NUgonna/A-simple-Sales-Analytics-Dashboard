# Sales Analytics Dashboard
The main purpose of creating a dashboard is to give a quick overview of specific KPIs used to measure the performance of a project/ a process/a company. The sales analytics dashboard below provides a unified view of sales for a certain company across 3 years. The tile on the dashboard shows the revenue of the company in the current year (2020), from the look of things,annual revenue growth is down by 21.9% from the prior year based on the period of data gotten.

Before designing the dashboard, these were the processes I took: • Selection of KPIs
    • Collection of Data : The dataset used for this dashboard is a free dataset from kaggle.com
    • Data Cleaning
    • Data Modelling (I worked with 3 different tables in a CSV sheet, the relationships between the tables the tables were performed in Tableau Public
