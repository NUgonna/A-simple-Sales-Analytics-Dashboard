# Sales Analytics Dashboard

The purpose of creating a dashboard is to give a quick overview of specific KPIs used to measure the performance of a project/ a process/a company. The sales analytics dashboard below provides a unified view of sales for a certain company across three years. The first tile on the dashboard shows the revenue of the company in the current year (2020). From the look of things, annual revenue growth is down by 21.9% from the prior year based on the period of data. 

Furthermore, bikes contribute approximately 96% of the overall sales from 2018 to mid-2020, and the company's major markets are the United States and Australia, each contributing 31.7% and 29.5% respectively to overall sales.


Before designing the dashboard, these were the processes I took: 
• Selection of KPIs 
• Collection of Data : The dataset used for this dashboard is a free dataset from kaggle.com
• Data Cleaning
• Data Modelling (I worked with 3 different tables in a CSV sheet, data was modelled in Tableau Public)
